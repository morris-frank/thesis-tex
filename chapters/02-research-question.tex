\section{Research Question}

Source separation is the task of finding a set of latent sources \(\B{s} = [\B{s}_1,\…,\B{s}_n]\) to an observed mix of those sources \(\B{m}\). The induced model proposes a mixing function \(\B{m} = f(\B{s})\) which might just be a liner mixing \(\B{m} = \B{A}\·\B{s}\). The task is to find the inverse model \(f^{-1}(\·)\) which retrieves \(\B{s}\).
