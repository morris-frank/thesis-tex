\chapter{Conlusion}
In this research work, we introduce a new approach to unsupervised source separation. We describe theoretically that source separation can be achieved by modelling the generative process of the mixed signal from which then likely latent sources are extracted. Because we propose to model the data distribution of each signal source independently we remove the necessity of having mixed-unmixed training pairs. We sketch out two approaches to samples those sources, either by learning separate approximate posteriors or by directly sampling from the prior density under the mixing constraint.

Our experiments reinforce a suspicion that was also experimentally found in prior work under different circumstances. Current deep generative models do not learn a density that is discriminative against out-of-distribution samples.
