# Unsupervised musical source separation

The XeLateX source for my master thesis at the amsterdam machine learning lab.

To build the PDF run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

which runs `./figures.py`, `xelatex` and `biber`.

All Figures in the document are generated by the `figures.py` script. The folder `./graphics` can be deleted and regnerated by running the script.
